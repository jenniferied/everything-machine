## Key Findings

### What is Artistic Research?
*(To be filled after Phase 1)*

### Citation Landscape
*(To be filled after Phase 2)*

### Discovered Domains
*(To be filled after Phase 3)*

## Notes

- This is an exploratory approach - domains are discovered, not prescribed
- AR field likely has lower citation counts than CS/AI
- Focus on relevance to Kepler project, not just citation counts for AR venues

## Next Actions

1. Process professor-provided texts (Phase 1)
2. Run exploratory searches (Phase 2)
3. Define domains based on discoveries (Phase 3)
