## Key Concepts for Thesis

### Boden's Creativity Types
- **Combinational**: New combinations of existing ideas
- **Exploratory**: Exploring conceptual space
- **Transformational**: Transforming conceptual space

### Colton's Creative Tripod
- Skill, Appreciation, Imagination
- Applicable to evaluating Kepler's "creativity"

### Emergence
- Qualities arising from process neither party intended
- Central to thesis argument about hybrid aesthetics

### Authorship Questions
- Who is the artist: user, AI, or both?
- How does prompt engineering constitute authorship?
- Kepler as collaborative entity

## Diffusion Model Art Discourse (2022-2025)

Recent debates:
- DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion impact
- Artist backlash and copyright concerns
- "Promptcraft" as artistic skill
- Democratization vs. devaluation of art

## German-Language Sources

- Ästhetik der Algorithmen
- Generative Kunst / Algorithmische Kunst
- Computergenerierte Kunst
- KI und Kreativität

## Notes

- **Citation sources:** WebSearch/S2 = verified via Semantic Scholar search results; estimate = from model knowledge, needs verification
- Boden and Colton essential for theoretical grounding
- Generative art theory (Galanter) predates current AI art discourse
- Thesis can bridge generative art theory with contemporary AI tools
- Emergence concept key for describing Kepler's aesthetic qualities
