## Key Themes for Thesis

1. **Workflow Transformation**
   - Iteration cycles (prompt → generate → select → refine)
   - Curation as creative act
   - "Happy accidents" and serendipity

2. **Agency & Control**
   - Steering generative models
   - Prompt engineering as skill
   - Balancing control vs. surprise

3. **Creative Identity**
   - How AI changes artistic voice
   - Hybrid authorship
   - Signature style with AI tools

## German-Language Sources

Consider searching:
- Kreativität und KI (German journals)
- Mensch-Maschine-Kollaboration
- Digitale Kunstpraxis

## Notes

- **Citation sources:** WebSearch/S2 = verified via Semantic Scholar search results; estimate = from model knowledge, needs verification
- Academic literature lags behind practice
- Artist interviews and case studies valuable
- Focus on workflow transformation aligns with research question
