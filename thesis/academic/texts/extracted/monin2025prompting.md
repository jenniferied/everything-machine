## Abstract

The paper documents a creative collaboration between two design researchers who use text-to-image prompts as a way to think across a range of ideas — including the relationships between collage practices and AI image generation (both modes of image-making that create images with images) — while taking an "anarchival" approach to addressing absence in historical archives.

Initial experimentation with prompt-based model DALL-E 2 involved writing multiple prompts to generate images of the extinct King Island dwarf emu, specifically an emu taken to live in Empress Josephine's estate outside Paris. There is little visual record of the dwarf emus, and what remains is ambiguous and factually inaccurate.

The researchers began to consider prompting with large-scale image generation models as a way to think-with and speculate, rather than to merely generate, employing visual content analysis and comparative analysis across image-generation models to critique the resulting images.

They conclude that at a time of both deliberate and accidental miscommunication, it is important for those with expertise in how images "work" to critique and analyse image-generating tools, and to consider how working with generative AI might be included as part of an anarchival practice.

## Historical Subject: The King Island Dwarf Emu

The paper focuses on two extinct Australian subspecies:
- **King Island emu** (*Dromaius novaehollandiae minor*)
- **Kangaroo Island emu** (*Dromaius novaehollandiae baudinianus*)

Both were distinct island subspecies that had evolved in isolation for thousands of years, reaching only half the height of mainland emus. Their extinction followed European colonisation: sealers and farmers arrived on the islands, hunted the birds for food and sport, and within decades drove both subspecies to extinction.

Several specimens were collected during Nicolas Baudin's French scientific expedition (1800–1804) and transported to France, where they were housed at Empress Josephine Bonaparte's estate, **Malmaison**, outside Paris. The birds subsequently lived at the **Jardin des Plantes** in Paris, where they died in 1822 — making them likely "endlings" (the last surviving members) of their subspecies.

### Archival Gaps and Unreliable Documentation

What survives is fragmentary:
- A single King Island emu feather at the **Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery** (gifted in 2000)
- Skeletal remains at institutions in Paris and Florence
- A taxidermy mount in Geneva
- Lesueur's historical illustration — the only detailed visual record of the emus in life

The Lesueur illustration is itself considered **scientifically unreliable**: art historian scholarship suggests it depicts both a Kangaroo Island emu and a King Island specimen together in an anatomically impossible family grouping, arranged to reflect "Revolutionary philosophical expression" rather than ornithological accuracy. Three different subspecies may be depicted together — they would never have met in the wild.

This archival unreliability is central to the paper's case study: the researchers use a subject for which visual documentation is scarce and misleading.

## Theoretical Framework

### Thinking-With (Haraway)

The central theoretical concept draws on **Donna J. Haraway's** notion of "thinking-with" — understanding knowledge creation as inherently **relational** processes involving human and non-human entities. Rather than treating generative AI as a neutral tool that fills in archival gaps, the authors position prompting as a way to "think-with" the technology itself: to acknowledge the "expansive relationality of such image-making processes across human and non-human."

This means interrogating what the AI system does with visual information — how it reorganises, recombines, and represents — rather than simply accepting outputs as images of the subject.

### Anarchival Practice

The paper introduces "anarchival practice" as a methodological concept:

> Anarchival practice involves troubling what is missing or omitted from historical archives, how these archives are organised, and how archival materials might be reactivated in critical and creative ways.

This frames speculative visualisation not as falsification but as a critically engaged mode of addressing historical absence — a practice that acknowledges gaps and uses creative tools to think around them.

### Collage and AI Image-Generation as Parallel Practices

The authors draw an explicit conceptual parallel: both **paper collage** and **AI image generation** are modes of "creating images with images." Both work by recombining and reassembling existing visual material rather than originating images from scratch. This parallel motivates their comparative methodology.

## Methodology

The research proceeded in three phases:

### Phase 1: Parallel Collage and Prompting

Researchers created **paper collages** from archival photographs and historical materials as a way to physically think through the fragmentation of the historical record. They then wrote prompts for **DALL-E 2** to generate images of the dwarf emu in Paris.

The collages initially felt incomplete — "missing the inherent strangeness of the narrative." The AI-generated images, by contrast, produced unexpectedly unsettling imagery that captured an uncanniness the hand-made collages lacked.

### Phase 2: Features-by-Proxy Analysis

The researchers conducted a **"features by proxy" methodology**: they performed reverse image searches on the AI-generated images to identify what training-data characteristics and visual sources appeared (by proxy) in the outputs. This reverse-engineering approach makes visible the underlying visual logic of the generative model.

### Phase 3: Cross-Model Comparative Analysis

The same prompts were tested across **multiple image-generation models** (including DALL-E 2 and Midjourney) to investigate how different systems visualise the same historical subject differently. The comparative analysis reveals how training data composition and model architecture shape outputs.

### Analytical Framework: Formal and Cultural Critique

The authors distinguished two registers of image critique:

- **Formal analysis**: examining composition, line, shape, colour — the traditional tools of visual literacy
- **Cultural/ethical analysis**: examining what images accomplish socially, what assumptions they embed, what they communicate about historical subjects

Both registers are applied to the AI-generated images.

## Key Findings

1. **Prompting as a mode of thinking, not just production.** The paper argues that the act of writing prompts — specifying what to visualise, what historical context to invoke, what aesthetic approach to use — is itself a form of creative and intellectual work analogous to visual research. Prompting is thinking-with, not just instructing.

2. **Generative models reveal their training data.** The "features by proxy" analysis showed that outputs reflect the visual biases and conventions embedded in training datasets. For a subject with few accurate historical images (the dwarf emu), the model draws on whatever proximate visual categories are available — revealing how it "fills in" absence with pattern.

3. **The uncanny value of AI outputs.** Where hand-made collages felt incomplete, AI-generated images produced an unexpected unsettledness — the "inherent strangeness of the narrative" — that the researchers found productive rather than troubling. The strangeness of the outputs became a research finding in itself.

4. **Visual literacy is necessary for AI critique.** The authors argue that design researchers with expertise in how images work are especially positioned to critically examine image-generating tools. At a time of widespread visual misinformation, this expertise is urgent.

5. **Cross-model variation is significant.** Different generative models produce meaningfully different visualisations from the same prompt, reflecting different training choices and architectural decisions. Comparative analysis surfaces these differences as data about the models themselves.

## Position on AI as Creative Tool

Sadokierski has stated explicitly (in documentation of the related book project "Me versus DALL-E"):

> "A collaboration requires a two-way conversation. The AI tool is a service provider, which I have used within a human-driven creative process."

The paper therefore does **not** claim AI as a creative co-author or collaborator in the strong sense. Instead, it positions AI as a tool within a **human-directed** research and creative process — one that can nonetheless be "thought-with" critically and productively.

## Related Book: *Me versus DALL-E* (Sadokierski, 2023)

The ArteActa paper appears to be a scholarly elaboration of an earlier creative project. Sadokierski's book "Me versus DALL-E" (2023, Blurb Books) used cut-paper collage alongside DALL-E 2 generated images to visualise the final days of the dwarf emus at Malmaison. The book documented experimentation with text-to-image prompting as a creative practice, raising the questions about collage, AI, historical absence, and visual uncanniness that the 2025 ArteActa paper theorises more formally.

## AI Tools Used

- **DALL-E 2** (OpenAI) — primary tool for image generation
- **Midjourney** — used in comparative cross-model analysis
- Reverse image search tools — for features-by-proxy methodology

## Relevance for Thesis (Everything Machine / Kepler)

- **Practice-led research**: The paper is a strong example of practice-led artistic research (Borgdorff, Frayling lineage) using a making-and-reflecting methodology.
- **Prompting as creative method**: Directly relevant to positioning prompt engineering as cognitive/creative work rather than mere instruction.
- **Anarchival practice**: The concept of using AI to engage with absence and incompleteness resonates with Kepler as a constructed identity without prior existence.
- **Critical stance on AI tools**: The "thinking-with" framing (not collaboration, not mere generation) offers a nuanced position between uncritical AI enthusiasm and dismissal.
- **Collage parallel**: The collage/AI parallel could inform how to describe the Kepler image-generation workflow theoretically.
